"""Held-keys overworld link-state engine - the keepalive + sit-at-RIGHT-seat + exit FSM.

The real FRLG child runs CB1_UpdateLinkState every VBlank [src/overworld.c:2579-2599]: it calls
the active key-intercept callback to produce ONE key code, runs it through UpdateHeldKeyCode
(clamp to [0x11,0x1D] else EMPTY) into gHeldKeyCodeToSend, and SendKeysToRfu emits
RFUCMD_SEND_HELD_KEYS (0xBE00) with gSendCmd[1]=gHeldKeyCodeToSend [link_rfu_2.c:1069-1080,
1315-1316]. This module reproduces that callback chain so the sim, during the overworld/seat
phase, emits a real 0xBE00 keepalive slot every VBlank instead of an all-zero idle.

Why this matters (decomp-verified):
  * The host's seat barrier GetCableClubPartnersReady [overworld.c:2989-3000] clears at
    CABLE_SEAT_SUCCESS only when AreAllPlayersInLinkState(PLAYER_LINK_STATE_READY=0x82) over
    i in [0, gFieldLinkPlayerCount). For a 2P trade BOTH slot 0 (host) and slot 1 (us) must be
    READY. The host drives OUR slot from the key we send: UpdateAllLinkPlayers truncates the key
    to u8 [overworld.c:2776] and HandleLinkPlayerKeyInput's tail switch [overworld.c:2749-2766]
    maps key READY(0x16)->sPlayerLinkStates[1]=READY, EXIT_ROOM(0x17)->EXITING_ROOM,
    IDLE(0x1A)->IDLE, EXIT_SEAT(0x1D)-while-READY->BUSY. So we reach READY by emitting 0x16 once.
  * CheckRfuKeepAliveTimer [overworld.c:2623-2626] does ++sRfuKeepAliveTimer>60 -> FatalError. This
    is a CHILD-LOCAL liveness watchdog, NOT a wire-cadence requirement: sRfuKeepAliveTimer is RESET to
    0 ONLY by SetKeyInterceptCallback, i.e. when the active key-intercept callback CHANGES
    [overworld.c:2614-2616]. The keepalive callbacks (KeyInterCB_Idle [2867-2871],
    KeyInterCB_DoNothingAndKeepAlive [2924-2928], KeyInterCB_Ready while NOT-yet-ready [2946],
    KeyInterCB_WaitForPlayersToExit while not-exiting [2968]) call it every frame, so it would trip a
    state that never transitions for >60 frames - but it is the CHILD's own check, decoupled from what
    is on the wire. Importantly, ONCE SEATED (KeyInterCB_Ready with sPlayerLinkStates[self]==READY) the
    callback returns EMPTY WITHOUT calling CheckRfuKeepAliveTimer [2941, the READY branch] - so the
    timer is NOT even running while we hold the seat. The reason linkstate emits a 0xBE00 EVERY VBlank
    in the seat phase is the HOST's view of our liveness (so it keeps OUR slot alive / sees READY),
    NOT this child-local timer. Outside the seat phase the child is on CB1_UpdateLink (the trade menu),
    which never runs this engine at all - so the per-frame 0xBE00 is strictly a seat-phase behavior.
  * gHeldKeyCodeToSend packing: SendKeysToRfu does `heldKeyCount++` THEN
    `gHeldKeyCodeToSend |= (heldKeyCount<<8)` [link_rfu_2.c:1076-1077]. heldKeyCount is a
    function-static u8, so the FIRST emit carries high byte 1 (NOT 0), then 2,3,... rolling mod
    256. The host stores gLinkPartnersHeldKeys[i]=gRecvCmds[i][1] (full u16) [link_rfu_2.c:1217]
    but reads it as `u8 key` [overworld.c:2776], so the high byte is a pure liveness nonce and
    the low byte is the key code.

RIGHT SEAT - resolved from the decomp, NOT from a chosen chair:
  There are TWO ids. (a) gLocalLinkPlayerId [overworld.c:120] = the wire mpId =
  GetMultiplayerId(); for the wireless child this is gRfu.multiplayerId = 1
  [link.c:965-971; link_rfu_2.c:1633-1638]. This is the index the WHOLE link-state machine uses
  (sPlayerLinkStates[gLocalLinkPlayerId] [overworld.c:2993-2997], CB1 selfId [overworld.c:2583],
  and the trade-menu partner index id^1 [trade.c:984-985,1008-1009]). (b) gLocalLinkPlayer.id
  (LinkPlayer field 0x18 [include/link.h:170]) set by SetLocalLinkPlayerId(gSpecialVar_0x8005)
  [cable_club.c:840; link.c:338-341] = the COSMETIC chair the player walked into. The chairs:
  TradeCenter_EventScript_Chair0 setvar 0 (x=4, LEFT), Chair1 setvar 1 (x=7, RIGHT)
  [data/scripts/cable_club.inc:637-649; data/maps/TradeCenter/map.json coord_events]. This chair
  id does NOT drive held-keys indexing. CONCLUSION: "RIGHT" = mpId 1 = gLocalLinkPlayerId = the
  joiner, whose trade partner is id^1 = 0 (the host, LEFT). The joiner SetReadyToTrade only fires
  when GetMultiplayerId()==1 [trade.c:1816], confirming mpId 1 is the Follower. So the sim is
  already the RIGHT seat by virtue of being the joiner; self_id is asserted == 1.

FSM (mirrors the child KeyInterCB callback chain):
  PRE_SEAT  (KeyInterCB_SelfIdle/_Idle [overworld.c:2856-2870]): emit EMPTY(0x11) every frame.
  -- sit() --> emit READY(0x16) on exactly ONE frame (KeyInterCB_SetReady [overworld.c:2951-2955])
  SEATED    (KeyInterCB_Ready/_DoNothingAndKeepAlive [overworld.c:2924-2948]): emit EMPTY(0x11).
              Slot 1 is now READY; stays here across the trade-menu and between sequential trades.
  -- exit() --> emit EXIT_ROOM(0x17) on exactly ONE frame (KeyInterCB_SendExitRoomKey
                [overworld.c:2977-2981]); print the cancel-to-leave intent to STDOUT.
  EXITING   (KeyInterCB_WaitForPlayersToExit [overworld.c:2962-2975]): emit EMPTY(0x11) until the
              host slot is also EXITING_ROOM; then -> SEND_NOTHING.
  SEND_NOTHING (KeyInterCB_SendNothing [overworld.c:2957]): emit EMPTY(0x11) keepalive.

Suppression / handoff: SendKeysToRfu does not emit when gHeldKeyCodeToSend==NULL or while
transferring data [link_rfu_2.c:1072-1074], and UpdateHeldKeyCode NULL-suppresses movement/idle
keys when GetLinkSendQueueLength()>1 [overworld.c:2793-2810]. In the sim this maps to: held-keys
keepalive replaces an IDLE slot ONLY - never a real SEND_BLOCK/LINKCMD slot. sim.py asks the
trade engine first; only if it returns idle does it emit this keepalive (see sim.py).
